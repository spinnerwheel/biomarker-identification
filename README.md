# Biomarker Identification with Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms

The idea is to use NSGA-II to find the best solutions, in terms of accuracy and number of genes, that are able to discriminate ill and healthy people using a set of genes.

I would suggest to create a virtual environment with `venv` for development.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spinnerwheel/biomarker-identification && \
cd biomarker-identification && \
python3 -m venv .env && \
source .env/bin/activate && \
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
